After you clone/download this project folder, rename it to something like export_741, or whatever number you would like to give to your custom body.
Custom body should be created via EMFS tool.

**Blender exporter tool** should produce more files like:
```
bsBlocks\part4_1_BindMatrixInverse.bs_block
bsBlocks\part3.0_1_content_MeshDataVertexData_2_morphs.bs_block
bsBlocks\part4_4_content_MeshDataBlendControl.bs_block
bsBlocks\part5_2_extraBlendControls.bs_block
bsBlocks\part6.bs_block
bsBlocks\URQqIII_bs.block
bsBlocks\URQqJJJ_bs.block
bsBlocks\part0.bs_block
bsBlocks\part3.1_1_content_MeshDataShaderArray.bs_block
bsBlocks\URQqAAA_bs.block
bsBlocks\URQqBBB_bs.block
bsBlocks\URQqCCC_bs.block
bsBlocks\URQqDDD_bs.block
bsBlocks\URQqEEE_bs.block
bsBlocks\URQqFFF_bs.block
bsBlocks\URQqGGG_bs.block
bsBlocks\URQqHHH_bs.block
```

Only after this you should be able to use the merge.bat tool to give you the custom body.
Look at the end of the merge.bat file to see how this custom body should be copied in your game folder.
